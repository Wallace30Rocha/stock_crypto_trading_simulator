# Project Stock & Crypto Simulator
Status (active)

# Project Objective
Continuation of my previous project Stock & Astrology.   
Provide a interactive experience to the user to find similarities between the moon phases and zodiacs connections with SP500 and the top 10 stocks and cryptocurrencies.  
The initial goal is to see if there is a match between them regarding the most and the least influential moon phases and costellations on the markets.     
We also provide another perspective that could be used as strategy to operate on the financial market.
