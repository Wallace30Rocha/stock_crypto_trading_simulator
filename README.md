# Overview
The Stock & Crypto Trading Simulator is a continuation of the successful project "SP500 Astrology," building upon the insights gained from identifying the most influential moon phases and zodiac signs affecting the SP500. This simulator empowers users to select an asset from a curated list of the top 10 stocks or 4 oldest cryptocurrencies. The primary objective of this project is to validate the trading strategy discovered in the previous research and assess its potential as a reliable approach to trading.
